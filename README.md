This repo contains binaries of Ursala language for [TIO](https://tio.run).

Sources of Ursala are [here](https://github.com/gueststar/Ursala), sources of Avram VM are [here](https://github.com/gueststar/Avram).

`avm` folder contains avm-files copied from [lib](https://github.com/gueststar/Ursala/tree/master/lib) and [src](https://github.com/gueststar/Ursala/tree/master/src).

Avram VM was built using [this `config.h`](https://github.com/gueststar/Avram/issues/1#issuecomment-353880795) on Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit, so `avram` is a 32-bit program.
